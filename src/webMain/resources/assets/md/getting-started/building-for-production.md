# Building For Production

To build a complete application optimized for production, run one of these commands:

```
./gradlew clean jsBrowserDistribution                   (JS target on Linux)
./gradlew clean wasmJsBrowserDistribution               (WasmJS target on Linux)
gradlew.bat clean jsBrowserDistribution                 (JS target on Windows)
gradlew.bat clean wasmJsBrowserDistribution             (WasmJS target on Windows)
```

The application files will be generated in the `build/dist/js/productionExecutable` or `build/dist/wasmJs/productionExecutable` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> When building an application generated by the Wizard, which includes a backend JVM target (used for SSR and/or RPC), you should use the `jarWithJs` or `jarWithWasmJs` tasks to build and package the complete application into a single JAR file located in the `build/libs` directory.
