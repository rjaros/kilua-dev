# Learning

This section gives you a deep understanding of building applications with Kilua. It covers the architecture, key concepts and most important features of the framework.

While learning and developing apps with Kilua, you may want to check the current [API documentation](https://rjaros.github.io/kilua/api/).

For those who like to learn by reading code, the sources below will be very useful.

- Different example applications can be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/rjaros/kilua/tree/main/examples). 
- Check SSR examples to see how to initialize Server-Side Rendering in different web servers.
- The [fullstack example](https://github.com/rjaros/kilua/tree/main/examples/fullstack-ktor-koin) shows how to create a fullstack application with Ktor web server and how to use different fullstack components.
- Be sure to check out the [realworld example](https://github.com/rjaros/kilua/tree/main/examples/realworld) - a fully fledged fullstack application based on the [RealWorld project](https://realworld.io) specification, supporting CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, SSR and more.
- [Shubham Singh](https://github.com/shubhamsinghshubham777) created a [Spotify Clone](https://github.com/shubhamsinghshubham777/SpotifyClone) demo application, which you play with at [https://spotify-clone-kilua.vercel.app/](https://spotify-clone-kilua.vercel.app/).
- This website is also a Kilua application fully designed with Tailwindcss and DaisyUI. The primary version is published as exported static site on GitHub Pages. The secondary version is powered by a Ktor server with full SSR, running as GraalVM native image in a Docker container published to GitHub packages and hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) with a free plan. You can check this version at [https://ssr.kilua.dev](https://ssr.kilua.dev) (it may require some time to activate). The full source code, including GitHub Actions workflow is available at [https://github.com/rjaros/kilua-dev](https://github.com/rjaros/kilua-dev).
